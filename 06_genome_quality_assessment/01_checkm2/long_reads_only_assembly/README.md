# CheckM2 Quality Assessment

This directory contains CheckM2 genome quality assessment results.

## Expected Output Files

- `quality_report.tsv` - Main quality report with completeness and contamination
- `checkm2.log` - Log file

## Key Metrics

- **Completeness**: Percentage of expected genes present
- **Contamination**: Percentage of contaminating sequences

## Quality Thresholds

- High quality: ≥90% completeness, <5% contamination
- Medium quality: ≥50% completeness, <10% contamination
